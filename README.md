singscribe is a work-in-progress [**Discord**](https://discord.com/) music bot built upon [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), the [**Discord.js**](https://discord.js.org/#/) API, and the [**discord-player**](https://discord-player.js.org/) framework.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository and `cd` into it:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/jktrn/singscribe.git
    cd singscribe
    ```

2. Install required `npm` dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. After installing the dependencies, you can run the bot with:

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

> **Note**: The `dev` script will run the bot with [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/), which will automatically restart the bot when changes are made to the source code.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The bot requires a Discord bot token to use the Discord API. [Follow this guide](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot) to create a bot application within Discord's developer portal to get a token.

> **Warning**: **Never, ever, *ever* share/commit your bot token** (or any API key in general)! Malicious users can use it to gain privileged access to your bot and any servers it is in. If you accidentally commit your token, [revoke it immediately](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#revoking-token-and-invite-link) and generate a new one.

After you've acquired your token, copy the `.example.env` file, which contains such:

```env
TOKEN="token"
TEST_GUILD="123456789"
```

Name this new file `.env`, and replace the `TOKEN` value with your own. For test guild deployments, change the `TEST_GUILD` value to your testing server's ID (right-click on the server icon and select "Copy ID").

### üöÄ Deployment

To deploy slash commands to your test guild, run the following command:

```sh
npm run deploy
```

This will run the `deploy` script specified in `package.json` (`cross-env IS_SCRIPT=true ts-node src/scripts/deploy`), which will deploy the bot's slash commands to your test guild whenever commands are added or removed. **You do not need to run this script when you make changes to existing commands.**

To deploy functions to production (which includes all servers your bot is in), run the following command:

```sh
npm run deploy-prod
```

> **Note**: Discord production deploys take upwards of an hour to take effect. Ensure your command properly functions before running this script.
