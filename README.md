## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository and `cd` into it:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/jktrn/singscribe.git
    cd singscribe
    ```

2. Install required `npm` dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. After installing the dependencies, you can run the bot with:

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

The `dev` script will run the bot with [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/), which will automatically restart the bot when changes are made to the source code.


## ⚙️ Configuration

The bot requires a Discord bot token to use the Discord API. [Follow this guide](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot) to create a bot application within Discord's developer portal to get a token.

> **Warning**: Never, ever, *ever* share/commit your bot token (or any API key in general). Malicious users can use your token to gain access to your bot and any servers it is in. If you accidentally commit your token, [revoke it immediately](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#revoking-token-and-invite-link) and generate a new one.

After you've acquired your token, copy the `.example.env` file, rename it to `.env`, and replace the `TOKEN` value with your own. For test guild deployments, change the `TEST_GUILD` value to your testing server's ID (right-click on the server icon and select "Copy ID").
